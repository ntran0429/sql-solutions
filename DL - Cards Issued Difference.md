## The Question

Your team at JPMorgan Chase is preparing to launch a new credit card, and to gain some 
insights, you're analyzing how many credit cards were issued each month.

Write a query that **outputs the name of each credit card and the difference in the number of issued cards between the month with the highest issuance cards and the lowest issuance.** Arrange the results based on the largest disparity.

## My Solution

```sql
WITH total_issues AS
(SELECT
card_name
, issue_month
, issue_year
, SUM(issued_amount) AS total_issued
FROM monthly_cards_issued
GROUP BY card_name, issue_month, issue_year)

, max_min AS
(SELECT
card_name
, MAX(total_issued) AS max
, MIN(total_issued) AS min
FROM total_issues
GROUP BY card_name)

SELECT
card_name
, max - min AS difference
FROM max_min
ORDER BY max - min DESC
```

I made an unnecessary use of CTEs, a cleaner SQL query is below:

```sql
SELECT
card_name
, MAX(issued_amount) - MIN(issued_amount) AS difference
FROM monthly_cards_issued
GROUP BY card_name
ORDER BY difference DESC
```

## My Thought Process

Each row represents an issue amount per month for any particular credit card

we can do the aggregation (max - min) right away in the main query

The final output is:

| card_name | difference |
| --- | --- |
| Chase Sapphire Reserve | 30000 |
| Chase Freedom Flex | 15000 |

## The Data

### `monthly_cards_issued` Table:

| Column Name | Type |
| --- | --- |
| issue_month | integer |
| issue_year | integer |
| card_name | string |
| issued_amount | integer |

### `monthly_cards_issued` Example Input:

| card_name | issued_amount | issue_month | issue_year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chase Freedom Flex | 55000 | 1 | 2021 |
| Chase Freedom Flex | 60000 | 2 | 2021 |
| Chase Freedom Flex | 65000 | 3 | 2021 |
| Chase Freedom Flex | 70000 | 4 | 2021 |
| Chase Sapphire Reserve | 170000 | 1 | 2021 |
| Chase Sapphire Reserve | 175000 | 2 | 2021 |
| Chase Sapphire Reserve | 180000 | 3 | 2021 |

### Example Output:

| card_name | difference |
| --- | --- |
| Chase Freedom Flex | 15000 |
| Chase Sapphire Reserve | 10000 |

### Explanation:

Chase Freedom Flex's best month was 70k cards issued and the worst month was 55k cards, so the difference is 15k cards.

Chase Sapphire Reserveâ€™s best month was 180k cards issued and the worst month was 170k cards, so the difference is 10k cards.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example**!
